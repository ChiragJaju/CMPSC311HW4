# CMPSC311HW4
Please just modify cache.c then run make and ./tester in the terminal. It may not run on your native OS, please use a linux vm instead.
Modify cache.c by implementing the functions given in the README.pdf file which is the actual assignment desscription. Running make and 
./tester in the terminal at the folder gives you the score to check whether the functions work or not. Currently it is at 21/25 if it is 25/25 the project
is done. You cannot hard code the return values, please implement the function in README.pdf. I have already started working on cache.c please work on that 
folder.
